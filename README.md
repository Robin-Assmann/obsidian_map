# Interactive Map for Obisidian
Unity Application to display Obsidian Entries on an interactive Map.
You are able to create points of interest (sites), areas (regions) and splines (roads).
In my personal use, i am using it to display my own custom D&D World which i created via [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
